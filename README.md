This project studies the sequence alignment and binding affinities between the human receptor ACE2 and the four types of coronaviruses: (1) the bat coronavirus, (2) the pangolin coronavirus, (3) SARS CoV (2002), (4) SARS CoV-2 (2019). This serves as a introductory discussion on the role of pangolin as the intermediate host for Covid-19.
